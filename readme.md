## Description

Neovim is a fork of Vim with additional features, striving to improve the extensibility and maintainability of Vim. It provides better scripting, plugins, and integration with modern GUIs with almost all of Vim's features.

I've built my Neovim config from scratch with the help of many resources and people (Special Thanks to **The Primeagen & Chris@machine**), which took me more than 30hrs to build.



#### **Main Technologies:**

- Vimscript 
- Lua

## Why is NVIM - **The Best Editor Ever!**

- Free and Open Source
- Very Well Documented
- Vibrant Community
- Highly Portable, Customizable, Extensible
- Supports all Languages and Formats
- Uses Less Of System's Resources
- Fastest Editing Power
- Much Needed For Linux based Systems and Servers
